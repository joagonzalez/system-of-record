Based on the project's requirements and structure, I'd recommend using YAML 1.2 for the following reasons:

1. **JSON Compatibility**
   - YAML 1.2 was specifically designed to be a strict superset of JSON
   - This is important for your project because:
     - You're using JSON schemas for validation
     - The API returns JSON responses
     - This makes the conversion between YAML and JSON more reliable and predictable

2. **Improved Security**
   - YAML 1.2 removed some potentially dangerous features present in YAML 1.1
   - For example, it removed automatic type detection of values like `YES`, `NO`, `ON`, `OFF`
   - This is crucial for a system of record where data integrity is paramount

3. **Better Number Handling**
   - YAML 1.2 has more consistent number handling
   - This is important for your configuration files that contain:
     - Network parameters (ASNs, IP addresses)
     - Version numbers
     - Hardware specifications

4. **Strict Mode Support**
   - YAML 1.2 introduced a strict mode that can help catch errors early
   - This aligns well with your validation pipeline requirements

Example of how YAML 1.2 would benefit your configs:

```yaml
# network/params/routing.yaml
bgp:
  # ASN is explicitly parsed as integer in 1.2
  asn: 65000
  enabled: true  # Boolean is explicit, not string "true"
  peers:
    - ip: "192.168.1.1"  # String explicitly quoted
      remote_asn: 65001
      weight: 100.5  # Floating point numbers are consistent

# software/versions/production.yaml
versions:
  app_version: "2.1.0"  # Version strings should be quoted
  build_number: 42      # Numbers remain numbers
  features:
    enabled: true       # Boolean, not "YES" or "ON"
```

To implement this in your project:

1. **Parser Configuration**
```python
# In your API service
import yaml

def load_config(path: str):
    with open(path, 'r') as file:
        # Explicitly specify YAML 1.2
        return yaml.safe_load(file, version='1.2')
```

2. **CI/CD Validation**
```yaml
# In your GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Install dependencies
  run: |
    pip install pyyaml>=5.1  # Ensures YAML 1.2 support
```

3. **Schema Validation**
```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "bgp": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "asn": {"type": "integer"},
        "enabled": {"type": "boolean"},
        "peers": {
          "type": "array",
          "items": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
              "ip": {"type": "string"},
              "remote_asn": {"type": "integer"},
              "weight": {"type": "number"}
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

4. **Documentation**
Add to your project documentation:
```markdown
## YAML Configuration Standards

This project uses YAML 1.2 for all configuration files. Key requirements:

- Always quote string values that could be interpreted as other types
- Use explicit boolean values (true/false)
- Use explicit number types (no octal format)
- Follow strict YAML 1.2 syntax
```

The choice of YAML 1.2 provides:
- Better security
- More predictable parsing
- JSON compatibility
- Strict validation options
- Clear type handling
